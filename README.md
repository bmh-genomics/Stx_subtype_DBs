# Stx_subtype_DBs
Databases for shiga toxin (stx) subtyping in fasta format. 

***Current databases for stx2 do not include the stxm subtype; this will be added in a future commit.***

stx2_nt_subunitA-spacer-subunitB: An stx2 nucleotide sequence database that includes the full CDS of subunit A, a spacer region, and the full CDS of subunit B. Upstream/downstream sequences were removed as appropriate. 

stx2_aa_subunitA: An stx2 amino acid sequence database that includes the full CDS of subunit A.

stx2_aa_subunitB: An stx2 amino acid sequence database that includes the full CDS of subunit B.

stx2_aa_subunitA-B_joinedDB: An stx2 amino acid sequence database that includes the full CDS of subunit A joined to the full CDS of subunit B.

NCBI accession numbers and other information used to generate the databases are in the attached file:
